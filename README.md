# Rice Classification
In this Deep Learning project, I used a pre-trained model called VGG16, which is a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) consisting of 16 layers. For more information, visit [this link](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ref/vgg16.html#:~:text=VGG%2D16%20is%20a%20convolutional,%2C%20pencil%2C%20and%20many%20animals).

In addition to the project, this repository contains 3 assignments, with all four works submitted to "Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to  GANs", an online course offered by [Jovian](https://jovian.com/).
<br><br>

### Assignment-1: Tensor Operations
### Assignment-2: Insurance Cost Prediction Using Linear Regression
### Assignment-3: Image Classification Using Feedforward Neural Network
